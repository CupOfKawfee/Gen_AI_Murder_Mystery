Rome;Spaghetti Bolognese;"166.67 g butter; olive oil, a small amount; 2.67 large onions; 4 carrots; 4 celery stalks; 1.33 kg ground beef; white wine, a splash; milk, as needed (approx. 250–500 ml depending on sauce quantity); 2 cans tomatoes (400 g each); 4 garlic cloves, sliced; 4 chili peppers, crushed; sea salt; freshly ground black pepper; 800 g spaghetti / pasta";The most important part of a proper Bolognese is the soffritto. Melt a generous amount of butter together with a little olive oil in a pan to prevent the butter from burning. Clean and peel the onions, carrots, and celery, then finely chop them. Cook the vegetables gently over very low heat for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft, translucent, and aromatic. The vegetables should sweat slowly and must not brown. In a separate pan, sear the ground beef over high heat until it develops a deep color. Deglaze with a splash of white wine, scraping up any browned bits from the pan. Depending on the amount of sauce, add about 250–500 ml of milk, which will mellow the flavor of the meat. Once the mixture comes to a gentle boil, add the canned tomatoes. Tomatoes similar to San Marzano are ideal due to their natural sweetness. When the sauce begins to simmer again, stir in the prepared soffritto. Add the sliced garlic and crushed chili peppers, then season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Let the sauce simmer gently for as long as possible—ideally about 5 hours, but at least 2 hours. Add a little water or light broth occasionally if needed to prevent sticking. Cook the spaghetti in salted water according to package instructions and serve with the Bolognese sauce.;https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/772011180069862/Die-echte-Sauce-Bolognese.html?portionen=8

Once softened, carefully separate the cabbage leaves. For the filling, place about 500 g of the ground meat into a bowl. Cook the rice in salted water until partially cooked, about 10–12 minutes, then drain and let cool. Dice the onions and fry them gently in hot oil until golden but not browned. Add the rice and fried onions to the meat, season with salt and pepper, and mix thoroughly by hand until homogeneous.
