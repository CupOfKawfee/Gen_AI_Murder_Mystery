Warsaw;Rosó? (Rossu) – Polish Chicken Broth;"150 g chicken meat; 2 carrots; 0.25 celery root; 0.5 leek; 0.5 bunch fresh parsley; salt, to taste; freshly ground black pepper, to taste; Maggi seasoning, to taste; water, as needed";"The chicken meat can come from a whole soup chicken, chicken legs, wings, or a combination of these; the exact quantity is flexible. Traditionally, chicken hearts and gizzards are also used and add excellent flavor, though they are optional. Place the unskinned chicken meat into a large pot and cover with more water than the final amount of soup desired, as some liquid will evaporate during cooking. Cook the meat on its own for at least 20 minutes; if using gizzards, simmer for 45–60 minutes, as they take longer to become tender. Chicken hearts cook in roughly the same time as the meat. While the meat is cooking, peel and halve the carrots and celery root. Clean the leek thoroughly, remove the roots, and cut it in half. Once the meat has cooked for the required time, add the vegetables to the pot and simmer everything together for another 30 minutes. Strain the broth into a second pot using a sieve. Remove the skin and bones from the meat and cut it into small pieces; chop the gizzards as well, while the hearts may be left whole. Dice the carrots and celery root and return them, along with the meat, to the broth. Discard the leek. Season the soup with salt, Maggi seasoning, and freshly ground black pepper. Finely chop the parsley and add it directly to the serving bowls just before serving.";https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/2740191426154452/Roso-Rossu-polnische-Huehnerbruehe.html
Warsaw;Pierogi Ruskie – Polish Dumplings with Potato and Cheese Filling;"500 g flour; 1 egg; 1 tbsp oil; 230 ml lukewarm water; 1 level tsp salt; 1 kg waxy potatoes; 500 g cottage cheese; 2 medium onions; salt; freshly ground black pepper";"Prepare the dough by kneading the flour, egg, oil, salt, and lukewarm water into a smooth dough. Roll the dough out thinly. For the filling, cook the potatoes in salted water until tender. While still warm, mash the potatoes and mix with the cottage cheese until smooth. Finely chop the onions and sauté them briefly in a pan until lightly browned, then fold them into the potato mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Cut out round shapes from the rolled dough using a glass and place a small amount of filling in the center of each round. Be careful not to overfill, as the filling may leak during cooking. Fold the dough over and press the edges firmly together, sealing with a fork. Knead together the remaining dough, roll it out again, and continue cutting and filling until all the dough is used; this should yield about 50 pierogi. Cook the pierogi in salted boiling water until they float to the surface, then continue cooking for another 2–3 minutes. Drain well. Serve about 10 pierogi per person, topped with sautéed onions in oil. Sour cream may be served on the side. Any leftover filling can be used to make additional dough or frozen. The pierogi can be prepared in advance and frozen in portions; cook directly from frozen in boiling water when needed.";https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/2109881340187882/Pierogi-ruskie.html
